# Tam Portfolio
*Note: This project is under rennovation and will be updated soon!*

This repository contains my portfolio website, which is built using React and Tailwind CSS. The website showcases my projects, skills, experience both personally and professionally.


## Interest and Hobbies
1. Software Engineer
I'm a full-stack/devops engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient applications. I love coding in my free time, especially releasing open-source projects.

I'm interested in cloud computing, infrastructure, and backend development.

2. Research Assistant/Independent Researcher
At the University of South Florida, I work as a research assistant for 2 labs, mainly in high-computing software, distributed systems, databases and machine learning. I also had interdisciplinary research experience in the field of computer science and biology.

I also have independent research experience in the field of machine learning and data science. My recent project LogosDB is a distributed text database friendly to large language models. It combines a full SQL storage, a vector database with a summarizer component to store and retrieve semantic information efficiently.

My on going project is Data Scientist Agent, where I am building a pipeline to convert complicated business problems into step-by-step execution plan, then creating ETL jobs to gather quantitative data and finally return a a comprehensive report. The pipeline also stores past iterations to enable self-learning mechanism.

3. Open Source Projects
I really enjoy creating/hosting open-sources projects. Most of the source codes are on my GitHub. Some noticeable projects are:
- CustomLambda: A completely open and lightweight alternative to AWS Lambda, which is a serverless computing service, built with Python and FastAPI.
- PyJSON Compiler: Imagine turning JSON into a programming language. PyJSON Compiler is a Python library that allows you to write code in JSON format, which is then compiled into Python code. This project is a fun experiment that showcases the flexibility of JSON and the power of Python.
- PyDragDrop: Extended frontend application of PyJSON Compiler, which allows users to combine different function blocks to create a runnable Python code.
- Agilizer: A web application helps startups manage customer feedback and convert them into actionable tasks according to Agile methodology. Built with Flask, React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Google Gemini.

4. Open Science
I'm curious about the underlying force that shape the world today. I learn Physics and Mathematics in my free time.

I love VFacts and Neil deGrasse Tyson's podcast StarTalk.

5. Extracurricular
In my free time, I love to give back to the community. I believe continuous learning is the key to success.

Since 2020, I founded and worked at several online communities to help students learn multidisciplinary knowledge, including:
- Google Developer Student Club (Tech Lead): Mentored students in project-based learning in software development, hosted workshops and hackathons.
- Buom Project: 16k followers on Facebook, 1k mentees, 200+ mentors; teach students about STEM and academic success.
- Youth for Cybersecurity: Spread awareness to Vietnamese students about the importance of cybersecurity and how to protect themselves online.
- KIPE Vietnam: Open science platform with 7k followers on Facebook, empowering students to explore science and technology.
